BUGS
- 160mm in calibration is not 160mm ?
	-> also should be 260mm (wtf)
- wdt overflow occurs without serial prints
- panic is called inside ISRs making the plotter unresponsive
	-> use assembly to reenable interrupts without jumping back

SMALL FEATURES
- frame/limit setting to center images
- direct movement controls 
- avoid false overshoot count during calibration

BIG FEATURES
- brown-out save routine
- CRC for serial communication
- buffer GCode commands to avoid stalls between operations
