BUGS


SMALL FEATURES

- y ramp during calibration

- frame/limit setting to center images

- keep a ~10 step safe border to allow less precise but faster drawing

- create a save/restore to EEPROM menu item

- direct movement controls 

- LCD text during y calibration (wait...)


BIGGER FEATURES

- scrolling menus 

- brown-out save routine

- PID control to get consistent X speeds


IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT COMLETELY TESTED:

- EEPROM storage for calibration and position

- parametric X ramp

- faster x speed for quickmove

- X axis watchdog timer
